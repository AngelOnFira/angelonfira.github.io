<h4 style = "padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px">This project objective was to create a pebble mosaic filter for digital photos. The project examines a different technique of digitally creating mosaics than other methods, such as Alejo Hausner's paper titled "Simulating Decorative Mosaics".<br><br>The code was written in C++, and is used as a pipeline between a digital photo and a Carleton graduate student's potential field thesis. First, the original photo would be segmented, then each region would be sent to the potential field code, making each region smoother, and look like a pebble. All of the new smoothed regions give an effect of a mosaic. <br><br> I worked with OpenCV to manage and process the images. I am currently working with Dr. David Mould to write a paper about the project.<br><br>Take a look the blog that goes along with the project. More picutres of the completed research will be available on there soon.
