<h4 style = "padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px">This was a project that I started when I was in grade 9. I started making it when I found out all of the neat things you could do with the Blitz 3D. I had taught myself a lot about simple programming from a book called "Game Programming for Teens", and I was ready to give it a try. I worked on the first version of the game for a few years, and managed a website with a small community and moderately frequent updates. You can find this version on my GitHub account.</h4>

<h4 style = "padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px">Looking back at the code of the game, I am amazed to see how far I have come. There are massive issues with the game logic, tons of programming malpractices, and lots of pointless redundancies. However, there are some concepts that I thought of that I found out later were actually used, such as a my "cd key generator", which hashed a number by doing simple mathematic operations to a system created number to get a computer-specific key.<br><br>The second version of the game was a project I started in grade 12. I decided to rewrite the code completely so that I wouldn't have to sift through my broken code to try and make it work. Since I was redesigning it from ground up, I decided that I wanted to create a network multiplayer option. As I was building this version, I came across many problems as I dove further into the understanding of netcode. A big problem to consider was how to compensate for the delay between computers over the internet. In the game industry, professionals use techniques to predict what will happen, as well as delay the visible player models. This is where the development of Blox Heroes has reached up to this point, however it is a project I will be continuing in the future.</h4>

<h4 style = "padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px">This was a project made at the 2016 Global Game Jam hosted at Carleton. With a team of 7 people, we were able to create a puzzle platformer in 48 hours. We used the real time collaborative engine "Superpowers" to write the game, which allowed us to all be editing the main game file at once.</h4>
